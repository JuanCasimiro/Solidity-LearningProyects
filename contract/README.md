```bash
npm install
```

## 🚀 Running Tests
Ensure contract integrity by executing:
```bash
npx hardhat test
```
For gas reporting:
```bash
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
```

## 📡 Local Blockchain Node
To deploy and interact with contracts locally:
```bash
npx hardhat node
```

## 📜 Smart Contract Deployment
Deploy contracts using Hardhat Ignition:
```bash
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```

## 🔍 Contract Verification
Verify your contract on **Etherscan**:
```bash
npx hardhat verify --network sepolia 0xYOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```
